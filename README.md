## Avengers-Endgame Blocker  
The function of this extension is straightforward – I love Marvel Cinematic Universe, and I have been invested into it since my childhood and I don't want to ruin the ultimate end to this series. 
This intractability combined with a love of surfing the internet has lead to a dangerous cocktail that this tool endeavors to support by blocking all elements on a webpage that could contain spoilers.

### How to use

* Clone and star the repository.
 
 ``` 
 git clone https://github.com/shubhank-saxena/endgame-spoiler-prevention.git
 ```
* Then open chrome and type
 
 ``` 
 chrome://extensions/ 
 ```
* Enable the Developer Mode on the right top corner and click on Load unpacked on left hand corner.
* Select the cloned repository and you'll see an extension is added with Cap's shield as an icon on your search bar.
* Voila! Now just click on the extension whenever you are surfing the internet to prevent all those unpleasant spoilers!

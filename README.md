## Avengers-Endgame Blocker  
The function of this extension is straightforward â€“ I love Marvel Cinematic Universe, and I have been invested into it since my childhood and I don't want to ruin the ultimate end to this series. 
This intractability combined with a love of surfing the internet has lead to a dangerous cocktail that this tool endeavors to support by blocking all elements on a webpage that could contain possible spoilers.

### How to use

 ``` 
 git clone https://github.com/shubhank-saxena/endgame-spoiler-prevention.git
